# jargo.dev

Welcome to **jargo.dev** — a personal web development starter kit and workspace designed for clean, scalable, and opinionated front-end projects.

---

## 🚀 Project Purpose

This repo serves as a streamlined sandbox for learning, building, and refining:

- Front-end layouts and interactions
- Coding standards (ESLint, Prettier)
- Markdown-based documentation
- Personal experiments, tools, and cheat sheets

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

Keep it clean. Stay modular. Code with clarity.  
Built for **momentum over perfection** — and optimized for devs who learn by doing.
